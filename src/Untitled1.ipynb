Player contracts would remain reasonably robust even without China since the surge was actually driven a TV deal signed in 2016 that enabled a massive cap spike. It's more that China projects to become a massive market that is \"essential\" to the NBA's growth - it is however, not essential to the continued success of the NBA nor the ability of owners to fulfill their financial obligations. The NBA is sustainable without Chinese money and will continue to be, the only argument otherwise is mostly driven by a nonsensical need for constant growth rather than being content with the massive amount of revenue the NBA already takes in.\n",

Renewals of the CBA will fix any major errors in relation to the league's stability. The impact of any event like this in terms of contracts will get flushed out in ~4-5 years time at the worst. Like by now, many mistakes that resulted from the miscalculating the future salary cap because of the 2016 spike have repaired with only a few major contracts that will expire very soon.

Let go!\" But it wasn't lost on me either that while i did know the man dragging me away, that if I was being kidnapped instead, it wouldn't make a difference, no one stopped to help or ask what was happening. I do remember a adult man looking at me sadly like he felt bad for me. And that's when I learned you can't depend on the kindness of strangers to help you.

Imagine how much more distressing it is to a child who's actually in danger. What if I was being kidnapped and nobody did anything, afterwards (especially if I was subdued/abused/threatened in the meantime) the next time I'm in public with my captor I'd probably be less likely to say anything because I wouldn't think anyone would help me anyway and I'd just get in trouble with my captor. I just wanted to give perspective. Also why the saying is \"if you see something, say something\"...doesn't mean you have to \"say something\" to the person you think is a bad guy, it really means say something to the authorities so they can follow up on it. Better safe than sorry. I also understand kids cry all the time, kind of like car alarms, if you hear a car alarm going off you never actually think a car is being stolen, but might help to look out the window just in case.     \n",

I'm an adult now, thank you...and so are you and might take it for granted how a child perceives these things.

I ultimately decided very firmly that we would be vaccinating, and I am also fully vaccinated now.*\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccines is not 100%, as I mentioned before. I mistakenly thought this was general knowledge, but that‚Äôs perhaps because of my own background. Vaccine effectiveness is different for each disease, for example the MMR vaccine provides about 90% immunity against measles and mumps, and 97% against rubella with the first dose. Once the second dose has been administered, 99% of recipients will be immune to all three diseases. DTaP vaccines are between 80-90% effective, with those who have all five (5) childhood vaccines for DTaP are much more likely to be immune. However, the vaccine is acellular, so it wanes quickly (effectiveness is reduced at a rate of around 27% per year).\n",
      "\n",
      "Effectiveness is concluded by calculating the difference between Attack Rate of Disease in Unvaccinated Populace (ARU) and¬†Attack Rate of Disease in Vaccinated Populace¬†(ARV) divided by ARV x 100\n",
      "\n",
      "So, (ARU ‚Äì ARV)/ARV X 100 = proportionate reduction of risk of infection in the vaccinated population. (Don‚Äôt know if that explains it, here is the link to an article on calculating vaccine efficacy: ¬†[https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/201/11/1607/850248](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/201/11/1607/850248)))¬†\n",
      "\n",
      "What do these numbers mean? Well, for every 100 people fully vaccinated for DTaP (and let‚Äôs face it, it‚Äôs probably not as high as it should be, a lot of adults don‚Äôt get boosters anywhere near often enough), between 10 and 20 of those people will not produce an immune response strong enough to suppress the development of Diptheria, Tetanus, or Pertussis ‚Äì although the effect of the disease might be reduced. To check this, titers could be drawn 6-8 weeks after the vaccine schedule is complete to check the level of immunity, but being realistic, that probably doesn‚Äôt happen. Therefore, those who have had the full vaccine schedule but for some reason or another didn‚Äôt build the immune response are still at risk of developing the disease. 10-20% of all vaccinated individuals isn‚Äôt a small amount. Nor, in fact, is 1-10% for the MMR, noting that most countries have the first dose at 12-18mo old and the next at 4 years old. That leaves 10% of vaccinated kids vulnerable to measles and mumps and 3% to rubella.¬†\n",
      "\n",
      "Herd immunity, if high enough, protects not only the vulnerable individuals who are too young, old, sick, immunosuppressed etc AND those who choose not to be vaccinated at their own risk, but also the percentage that slips through the cracks of vaccine effectiveness, including those who haven‚Äôt completed the entire schedule (which is spread out to allow the body to build immune responses and not overwhelm people) and those who have completed the schedule but haven‚Äôt gotten immunity (bad luck).\n",
      "\n",
      "Herd immunity also refers to the percentage of population that needs to be immune to a disease/vaccinated for a disease for the disease to stop circulating within the population. Imagine one small circle that is green surrounded by circles that are blue. The disease can only travel through green circles, so if there are enough blue circles surrounding the couple of green circles, the disease can only affect the one green circle who was unlucky enough to pick it up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vaccinations protect against disease \\*directly\\* for the individuals who are vaccinated, and \\*indirectly\\* the unvaccinated or non-immune by reducing the circulation of disease. The herd immunity threshold is different for all diseases because not all diseases represent the same rate of transmission (I.e. some diseases like whooping cough and measles are \\*much\\* more contagious than, say, meningococcal).\n",
      "\n",
      "Also fun fact ‚Äì the DTaP vaccine is less effective because it is now acellular. The whole-cell vaccine was much more effective at creating immunity, but as a result also posed more of a risk, so the current vaccine was developed because there were concerns for vaccine safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TLDR**; *Vaccines vary in effectiveness in the general population, and herd immunity is important to reduce the rates of infection and circulation of disease. Most of the population is, in fact, under-vaccinated and encouraging higher rates of vaccination will improve population outcomes in regard to disease control.*¬†\n",

      "\n",
      "Former red team planner for the government here. If there was a revolution in the US, the rest of the world would get involved, fast. Depending on the type of uprising, there is a large chance that it would not be a quick affair. It would be brutal, it would be bloody, and the US government could start a global scale war. Here are the top ten issues that came up.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) The US power grid can be taken down by a series of ‚Äúsurgical strikes‚Äù with the exception of the Texas grid. By surgical strikes, I mean a few marksmen (US army-tier Marksmen‚Äìthe minimum requirement) hitting certain spots on the grid would fuck a lot of the military and government because they need the grid more than Bubba and his friends do. Additionally, while all government agencies have backup generators, they will be hard pressed dealing with the resultant looting and other madness that would come with power outages. This would effectively create another front for the military. It would also turn the people against the government more quickly and paralyze the government‚Äôs propaganda machine. Worse still‚Äìthe key points of the US power grid are publicly obtainable information, and not only are the points too many to be effectively guarded, they are not guarded anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) The estimated desertion rate in case of a civil war is 75% in the case of a left-wing president. 50% of that would be assumed to immediately betray the president. The remaining (treasonous) military would be fighting its own. Yet another front created in the war. Additionally, there is an assumed 25-50% desertion or outright betrayal rate in three letter government agencies (FBI, CIA, NSA, ATC, TSA, etc.). Additionally, it is assumed that 5% of the initial 50% betrayers would stay in their job and become saboteurs. 10% of that 50% would contain key information that would be of critical danger to the US government. Of that 10%, 1% would be able to deliver that information to the US‚Äô foreign enemies. What you should get from this is that the second the United States government declares war on its own is the second it ceases to exist as the state we know it.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) ‚ÄúTea baggers,‚Äù ‚Äúright-wing extremists,‚Äù and ‚Äúoath keepers‚Äù which are considered untrained racists who aren‚Äôt ‚Äúgood with a gun‚Äù often are A) veterans who now have more time to have fun at the range, sometimes more than some Army units or Marine units. In addition to previous military training, B) often camp and do other outdoor activities‚Äìmore than many in the military do, as the focus has gone away from field exercises, and C) often have better equipment‚Äìoutside of armor and heavy weapons‚Äìthan the military. However, C) is kind of irrelevant because many of the places in which these people could hide would make the kind of war the US fights with the equipment they use pointless.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Outside influence is a huge problem. Russia has already stated they would back a Texas separatist movement, and right now we already have enough problem keeping Islam in check. The second the US has to fight in a ‚Äúcivil war‚Äù is the second it becomes a proxy war between NATO and whoever wants to mess with America. While America has amazing nuclear and air defense, if it comes to a civil war you have to assume that in a best cast scenario the US military is going to be operating at 50% capacity at best. Shit would go down. Hard. And fast. And if Russia‚Äìspoiler alert: one of the best militaries in the world at fighting in an urban environment‚Äìsent trainers and helpers to rebels, you can reliably bet that they would also possibly deliver weapons to them. So instead of fighting ‚ÄúTimmy TeaBagger,‚Äù you are fighting ‚ÄúTimmy TeaBagger who is buddies with Vlad.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "5) A civil war is not just the US versus the rebels. There will be looting. There will be rioting. Cities will burn. The National Guard cannot fight both the rebels and rioters in a city that would also cut off their supplies. Additionally, if you don‚Äôt think that the rebels will send in instigators into the cities‚Äìor worse, stand alone actors (A Lone Wolf on steroids. Think Timothy McVeigh, but instead of one van they have a whole fleet of them. A good movie example would be Bane)‚Äìyou would be mistaken. If the US government cannot even help its own people, why would its own people support the remaining (treasonous) military? Worse yet, if someone emptied out prisons (There are more prisoners in the US than there are people in the entire Chinese Army), you would have more crime than the police could ever handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Logistics and infrastructure in the US are crumbling and failing. Any war fought against a rebellion in the US would be a logistical nightmare, even before the rebels started going full Al-Qaida and putting IEDs in the road. A retired general who was contracting with us on the team said, ‚ÄúThe only thing holding together the US‚Äô infrastructure is duct tape and the will of the Department of Transportation. And often enough, there isn't enough duct tape.‚Äù Your most loyal cities to the US government, as we polled, are also the most logistically easy to cut off. NYC? San Fran? L.A.? D.C.? Baltimore? Most of them require crossing water to enter, from certain directions. Most of them have critical airports. Some of them have critical ocean ports. If anything happened to just TWO of the cities on the list, it would create a logistical clusterfuck.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Your ‚ÄúJohnny Reb‚Äù and ‚ÄúTimmy TeaBagger‚Äù states (i.e., ‚Äúred‚Äù states) all have something most of your ‚Äúoh so progressive,‚Äù ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt we so European,‚Äù ‚ÄúOh my god, we are just like Sweden,‚Äù blue states don‚Äôt. Blues are mainly consumer states. Reds are producer states. Urban areas don‚Äôt have farms. The second that shit goes down, realize a lot of those blue areas are likely to starve. In a civil war scenario, we predicted that at least 10,000 people would die of starvation if the war was not finished in a year. The numbers get worse after that. Or better, rather, for the country after the war.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) The US has way too many choke points, and the government forces would often be on the wrong side of them. This ties into the logistical nightmare, but it also has to do with an odd phenomena. Liberals like to live near the ocean. Many of the dividers of the country, like the Rocky Mountains, the Mississippi River, Appalachia, the Missouri River (fun fact: the biggest choke point for the US government is in Missouri) are red state areas. Sure, air travel is a thing, but a majority of the US government's needs would have to travel by ground. Even still, many of the major airports are outside of the city. Of course, the US would use military base air fields, but if civil war did break out‚Ä¶ which bases would be safe? Which ones would have fallen to the deserters?\n",
      "\n",
      "9) PR Nightmare. Every rebel killed on CNN would be spun as ‚Äúthe US government killed X Civilians today in a strike‚Äù on foreign news and pirate media not owned by the government. That is‚Äìas pointed out earlier‚Äìif the US media could even function in a civil war or uprising. Your ‚Äúrebel scum‚Äù know that the main thing that holds together the US‚Äìnay life in the US as we know it‚Äìis the 24 hour news cycle and the media. The second it's gone, you are going to have urban anarchy. If you are from America, can you imagine a day without TV, newspaper, or Internet? Your average urban youth can‚Äôt. If you don‚Äôt think that isn‚Äôt going to cause rioting, you must have a real high regard for how much restraint they have. Assume in a civil war that your ability to talk to the people is compromised. Also assume that in the case of a civil war that rebels may know how to monitor conversations like the US does, as there are manuals online on how to do so.\n",
      "\n",
      "10) This one is either 1 or 10, depending on who is asked. The US will never nuke its own. The second it does, they have lost the civil war and other countries will come to ‚Äúliberate‚Äù the US from its own ‚Äúrepressive regime.‚Äù Additionally, if any general, minuteman, nuke tech, or nuke sub captain decided to side with the rebellion, the US government is immediately SOL.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short: The second that a ‚Äúcivilian uprising‚Äù or ‚Äúextremist group terrorist attack‚Äù turns into ‚Äúcivil war‚Äù is the second the US loses. As a result, you will never see a civil war. You will see Waco, you will see Bundy Ranch, you will see all sorts of militant group confrontations and maybe even some skirmishes. But the US government fears its own people way the fuck too much to ever start a civil war. \n",

      "Basically, a Saudi diplomat, called Majed Hassan Ashoor, who lives in Jeddah, enslaved 2 Nepali housmaids when posted as a diplomat in India and along with over 22 of his Saudi diplomat friends (with diplomatic immunity), they raped, gang-raped, sodomized and sexually tortured 2 Nepali maids every day for over 4 months, ending September 2015. According to another source, it started when Mr. Ashoor asked for a \"massage\" and then raped the maids with other family members saying \"if you show any resistance, we'll kill you and throw you in the sewer\". Then the Saudi diplomat invited his diplomat co-workers to join in and it continued over months. Mr Majed Hassan Ashoor passed the maids around to over 20 of his friends who repeatedly gang-raped them. The maids said that sometimes, 7-8 Saudi diplomats raped them at the same time, they anally raped them and they even tortured the maids for their own sexual gratification and they had injuries all over their body. Two independent medical reports after the ordeal stated the maids suffered \"brutality\" and they had extensive injuries from their rapes and gang-rapes. If you think that's bad enough, all of this happened with the consent of his wife and his daughter, Roza Ashoor, who \"knew what was going on\". The wife of the Saudi diplomat also tortured and beat the maids, forced them to work 20 hour days and starved them and forced them to feed off scraps. Basically this enormous gang-rape and slave racket happened with the consent of his entire extended family and co-workers.\n",

      "Planned Parenthood is getting their data from the 1993 essay by biologist Anne Fausto-Sterling, who asserted that up to 1.7% of births either are or will become intersex later in life. However, this includes multiple conditions which are not recognized as intersex, such as Klinefelter's, Turner Syndrome, or [late-onset adrenal hyperplasia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910408/) \n",
      "\n",
      "Her definition of \"intersex\" is far too broad including those with differing hormonal levels, genitalia, chromosomes, or gonads (some of which do still match, some of which do not). Even Fausto-Sterling acknowledged that a portion of those categorized present no symptoms, and would not have known otherwise. XYY syndrome, for example, leads to nothing more than an increase in testosterone production in males, and presents no symptoms besides increased height and acne, possible bone weakness due to increased growth, and rare cases include clinodactyl (curved pinkie fingers). However, this would be considered intersex by Fausto-Sterling. Her definition of any deviation from the ideal lists late-onset adrenal hyperplasia (which accounts for 1.5% of births), Klinefelter (0.092%), Turner (0.0369%), other non-xx/xy (0.0639%), vaginal agenesis (vagina not fully developed, 0.0169%), complete androgen insensitivity (0.0076%), and more which accounts for less than 0.01% of the population in total. Only problem is that she did not include any of the top 5 in her case histories throughout any of her works, she only uses the small .02% (from vaginal agenesis onwards) to present for study. She excluded 99% of her definition of intersex because it didn't present well enough. \n",
      "\n",
      "A much better definition of intersex is where the phenotype (external) cannot be classified as male or female, or where the chromosomal sex is not consistent with the phenotypic sex. The only types that could (and honestly should) be classified as intersex are:\n",
      "\n",
      "vaginal agenesis, as explained above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complete androgen insensitivity, where males do not develop a penis and are born with a vaginal opening, which does not have a uterus or ovaries but rather undescended testicles. It's usually discovered during puberty when there is no menstruating. \n",
      "\n",
      "Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (not to be confused with late-onset), where excessive androgenic hormones are produced in-utero, leading to females with masculine genitalia or genitalia that's in-between. (0.0078%)\n",
      "\n",
      "However, a lot of the previous ones don't actually count as intersexual, most notably late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia (LOCAH). LOCAH accounts for 88% of the total number of intersex cases claimed (1.7% total cases claimed divided by 1.5% of cases being LOCAH). The main symptom of LOCAH in men is possible thinning of hair around age 50, which is not a very intersex-like symptom. In women, around age 24 on average, the main symptoms are infrequent periods, possible hair growth, and rarely infertility. 10% of cases reported minor clitoral swelling. Thus, LOCAH would not meet the definition of intersex. \n",
      "\n",
      "Klinefelter's (XXY) biggest indicator is infertility, but an unknown yet significant proportion of those with Klinefelter's are fertile, and will never discover what they have unless they go in to be checked for fertility, where most Klinefelter's cases are noticed and reported. How many fertile guys go in to see if they're shooting blanks? Other than that, there is reduced muscle mass, less body hair, and possible infertility. Again, not intersex. \n",
      "\n",
      "Turner Syndrome (X) can commonly be identified by a shorter stature and infertility of eggs, but can become successfully pregnant using donated eggs. Genitalia are always normal, and \"normal-presenting genitalia\" is used as an indicator that the symptom is Turner's and not a different developmental disorder. Again, not intersex. \n",
      "\n",
      "XYY was previously explained, with the main problem being slight mental retardation. This symptom is usually found when evaluating people for mental disability. Not intersex. \n",
      "\n",
      "XXX is the same, fertile but lowered intelligence. Not intersex. \n",
      "\n",
      "Vaginal agenesis is equivalent to a cleft palate of the vagina and can be fixed easily through surgery. Personally, I would not still consider this one intersex, but if left out then intersexuality would only occur in about 0.018% of the population, or 1.26 million people. With the 0.169% from this we have about 0.2%, which translates to about 14 million total, with 12.74 million of those having vaginal agenesis. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tl;Dr 99.8% of the world is not intersex if you include vaginal agenesis, or 99.982% is not intersex if you do not include it. This means that an intersex birth is either a 1 in 500 chance or a 1 in 5000 chance, depending on if vaginal agenesis is considered intersex. \n",

Laughter is always a game changer, an interjection, a way to make something good, a good feeling out of things that are bad. It's an anti-depressant but also an equaliser.

Perhaps collars were specially made and placed on particularly favorite dogs, thus supporting the stories of legendary dogs earning these collars, but the presence of the collar doesn't necessarily mean that the particular dog has dispatched a wolf. \n",

You can find any peeled wall and cheap freak in counters easy. You won't have to worry about a bed. Free mats inside, with 5% of the foam stuffing missing. Roaches keep you company. Damn I really need to stop smoking these things. These girls dont,get any friendlier. And the apartment owner knows my face every time. I've currently switched from my atypical syringe-N-plug hobbies to enjoy a more \"hard white\" free-base levitation. The roaches still stare from the corners. The rats still stalk em. The pussies still double guess before pulling the trigger on the rodents. Damn. It's a cycle, I know. Ya don't have to tell me. Its gonna happen, these things are meant to be. I guess one can only.. Relax... While hes waiting for his turn on the Ferris wheel. Heh... Dusk? Yeah... Some people get ready to clock out and wake up to a job they never dreamed of having and only dream of leaving.\n",
      "Me? Well.... I spend my time relaxing.. Kick back.. Light up. Let the spice of the wrap fill your nostrils. Beware of the dames. Don't tread too close to the rats. Get used to similar faces. Make friends. Even if they are just a roach.. And relax. 'Have a cigar' my ol' man would say.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "* He has his own \"rape fantasy essay\" that would have been run up and down the media.\n",
      "\n",
      "* He openly praised Castro and the Sandinistas, and called for curtailing of the press\n",
      "\n",
      "* He is obsessed with alternatives to medicine and hosts wacky conferences on acupuncture and shit. He has decades of writing about good health through positive vibes ... one such tract is the source of that quote about rape fantasies. The real story there isn't the insensitivity - its the assertion that orgasms help prevent cancer by encouraging mental health. His work to champion an absurdity called \"naturopathy\" and allowing practitioners to be licensed by the state of Vermont has lead to the resurgence of medical conditions unknown in the rest of the Union. Turns out injecting colloidal silver into your bloodstream is really stupid.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Environmentalists groups are appalled by his opposition to Nuclear power and research into improving nuclear power. He has said he would use executive power to refuse to renew licenses for nuclear power plants - forcing them to shut down without legislative consent. His crusade against the Yankee Power plant in Vermont succeeded and resulted in a spike in energy prices as well as a 7% increase in carbon emissions the following year - after 23 successive years of reduced carbon emissions in the state. Nuclear power is clean and green and pulling the plug on 19% of our energy grid would be devastating to both the environment and our economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Bernie is also on record in various forums shitting on women's and minority issues. He gave a speech to a fire fighter's union calling racism and reproductive rights a \"distraction\" from important economic issues. He did it in the primary as well. In a rolling stone interview he doubled down, insisting that reproductive rights are just a social issue. When asked about ferguson on The Ed Show he demanded that it be proven that the police were violating the protestor's rights - not that it be proven the protestors had done something that warranted by beaten, arrested, and buried in tear gas. Somebody should probably tell him that pregnancy, police brutality/bullshit arrests/murders, and hiring discrimination are, in fact, economic issues.\n",
      "Elizabeth Warren endorses Hillary's plan for banking regulation. Bernie has no plan. He has a slogan. \"Break up the banks!\". But when asked how exactly he admits he has no idea how or even if its possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Bernie's bill to reform health care is a gold plated gift to the republicans. It completely destroys all forms of socialized medicine in our country to fund itself. SCHIP, Medicaid, Medicare (it calls itself medicare but if you read it it is vastly inferior), Social Security Health payments, Tricare, all of it. Gone. Poof!. Paul Ryan's wet dream with a bow on top. The bill itself is then covered with self destruct buttons that let republican governors and a future republican president completely destroy Berniecare. Such as a provision that would allow a future president to reduce the funds allocated to the states by any amount but only increase them up to X% where X was the years GDP growth. Hi president Cruz! Whats that? You are zeroing out the Berniecare disbursements unilaterally as an executive action? Okey dokey. Bernie's idiot law says you can do that. And no future president can fix it since increases are limited. Oh I'm sorry, you live in one of the majority of states with a republican governor? Bernie stupidly let governors pick the committee that sets the pay rates for their state. And your governor chose people that set them all at amounts to low for doctors to afford to accept. Since Bernie outlaws any form of copayment no doctor in your town accepts berniecare and your card is useless. You still pay a new payroll tax for it but it isn't worth the paper its printed on. If any republican strategist actually read it they'd have it passed and on his desk in a jiff. Not only would all those socialized medical programs they hate be gone, they'd get to blame it on a democratic president who wrote, pushed, and signed the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "* While chair of the veteran's health committee Bernie showed that he is utterly blinded by ideology in that he repeatedly refused to investigate allegations of long wait times and poor service. The VA scandal revealed how lack of funding rendered the VA unable to provide medical care to vets in a timely manner resulting in poor health and deaths. There were attempts to whistle-blow about it for years that Bernie blew off because he \"knew\" that complaints about long wait times and such were just anti-socialized health care propaganda, not real problems. This shows that if he started doing stupid wrong shit as president he would ignore feedback that there are problems.\n",
      "\n",

I don‚Äôt see why the prisoners were not transferred some where else. I went on a hog hunt out there yesterday and had a neighbor tell me about all of this and let me know they had released the guy. No one should have to be locked up in those conditions. With the counties incompetence it now puts my family at risk. What a fucking shit show. I love Oklahoma and live in Tulsa but fuck this. Get your shit together there are people out on the street now that are dangerous criminals. Anyone living in these areas stay armed and keep an eye out for anything suspicious. Call game wardens or local pd if you need to but remember it will take a long time for them to arrive. Be safe. \n",

As a firefighter, we dont ‚Äúmask up‚Äù until levels are 35 ppm which is, per osha, the lowest number that protective measures should happen at. A lethal dose for humans is somewhere around 6,400 ppm for 30 minutes. If those numbers represent % of atmosphere, then 18 is most certainly deadly and any spark would make everything go kablooey. For the record, the lel (lower explosive limit of CO) is 12.5%, which is not a number referenced above. 10% atmosphere of CO equals about 12,500 ppm, which would be death within 1-3 minutes. \n",

      "Hospice physician here.  The intent to hasten death isn't something we do officially or even unofficially.  Groups are very liberal with medications in a way that you would never see for a non-terminally ill patient but it's not done to cause someone to pass.  The idea is to work backward from goals of care.  If a patient's goal is to have no pain, even if it means snowing them so they're out of it and they don't live as long, that's what we try to honor.  If it's time as a goal over pain control, then we are more conservative.  The idea that they wanted to get rid of your mother for a bed is absolutely terrible and I'm sorry if you had that vibe.  There is a scenario called palliative sedation which is done under certain circumstances but it's performed pretty rarely.  I would say of the people I've treated, with rare exceptions, we are very good at controlling discomfort.  You'd be surprised that some things we use are more for families benefit than the patient at the very end (things like atropine for secretions so people don't sound like they're choking, etc... At that point they're so out of it it's not likely to be uncomfortable but it can be very disconcerting for families to see).\n",

No resuscitation. Nothing was violent or traumatizing to witness. As devastated as we all were (are), the dignity and serenity of her dying process was, if anything, comforting. We were all unlucky that she got such a terrible illness so relatively young, but we should all be so lucky to die like she did. In the other person's death, their family tried to preserve the person's cogency even though they were 1. in extraordinary discomfort and 2. 96 years old. Even once the person was clearly not going to make it, the family refused any medicine they thought might be unnecessary, worried that they might be robbed of a single moment of deathbed consciousness. While the patient was definitely totally delirious by the time they died, the dying process was long, noisy, ugly, and frankly brutalizing for the family.

We've been to Beijing, Guangzhou, and Suzhou (a famous fashion city, I had 3 of my wedding dresses made there), including some driving through some rural areas. I've definitely handled fowl, and have eaten in small mom and pop type places. \n",

      "The first time started with feeling just crappy overall. I thought it was just jet lag or a cold, and didn't seek medical help-- especially when your aunties all have strange various remedies for you (example: a horribly bitter \"soup\" made with ground up seahorses). Then came a fever and painful body aches, and I was getting worried. Aunties assured me they knew how to care for me. I started vomiting and my fever spiked at 103.5, which made me decide to seek a real doctor (which kinda offended the 'aunties'- not all are actual family, just what we call close okder female family friends). Doctor gave me antibiotics and sent me home, after which I proceeded to have the worst chills, sweating, green diarrhea of that awful mucus (hence my googling of \"can your butt produce snot\"). I was stuck at a family friends home, embarrassed AF for stinking up their entire house. Around the 5th day I finally felt okay enough to proceed with the trip. By the 7th, I felt more or less back to my old self. \n",
      "\n",
      "The second time it happened, I was happy the trio went well. I met with the dress makers to pick the designs early on, and was able to see the progress at the end of the trip. I started feeling that overall malaise on the 17 hour flight home. That time I went to the doctor right away, was admitted to hospital, and even though it was still awful, but not as bad as the first. I keot apologizing to the poor nurses who had to help clean up the bed pans full of explosive green shits. At least I didn't get all that dehydrated that time thanks to the IV. \n",

      "Just so anyone reading thinks China is a horrible place and that you'll get sick, these were only the trips I got sick. I've been there many times in recent years and didn't have a single problem. I ate meals from family and friends homes-- meals you kinda have to eat as to not offend, and my health is already fairly compromised from having stomach cancer a decade ago. Since those awful experiences, I have a rule about only eating at respectable restaurants and close family I trust. Now, I bring my favorite crackers and my family will tell our family's friends that my stomach cancer is affected by other foods (I had surgery to remove most of my stomach, but I can still eat somewhat. I've been in remission ever since, but my mom will use it as good excuse to avoid eating something that might make me ill). \n",

If every human in our country (and ideally earth) can live in comfort with their needs met (biological and social), then I would never again mention income inequality as being important. I understand the value of a free market employment system, and further appreciate the absolute human need for incentives (which undermines the purest of communal economies), however, I do not believe that an economy's first duty is to efficiency. Its first duty is to universal sufficiency, and for the first time in human history, we finally have the means. When I see people making 1000x their fellow employees, and millions of times more than some fellow humans, it serves as a harsh reminder of the dispicable reason why people are still hungry, thirsty, sick, exhausted, exploited, ignorant, unrepresented, and dying unjustly around the world. \n",

When you've spent so long using 90% of your time finding money for, finding, obtaining, and doing dope, and 10% for literally every other aspect of life, you get good at surviving with that 10% of your time and effort.  When you get off dope, you magically have 90% of your waking time just completely free and open for anything you want, and can still survive on the other 10%.  Of course, then you spend more time on living well, but even if you spend 3 times the time and effort as you need, (and live 3 times better than you would) you still have 70% as free time to do whatever.  It makes it really easy to brush off all the other bullshit in life that people find incredibly stressful, as none of it holds a candle to living with dope.
