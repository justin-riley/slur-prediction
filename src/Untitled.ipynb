      "Some different breeds of dogs are technically considered different species, as they’re physically incapable of reproducing. However, all humans can reproduce with each other because we’re all the same species and much more homogenous then all breeds of dogs. Your comparison is incorrect and nullifies your argument.

This is called mechanical isolation.” https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/her/tree-of-life/a/species-speciation. Although they’re classified as the same species, this is because a chihuahua can mate with a bulldog, which can mate with a shitzu, which can mate with a yellow lab, which can technically mate with a wolf. Or some chain like that, you get the point. This can be seen with salamanders that have separated from each other in the wild that can’t mate with some salamanders in the same species but can with others. https://news.mongabay.com/2019/03/super-variable-california-salamander-is-an-evolutionists-dream/\n",
